=Installation of SLIMarray Lite

==Overview

SLIMarray Lite is incredibly easy to install and start using. It's only drawbacks are:

* Speed - it takes a long time to start, and may have a somewhat sluggish interface
* Database - it uses SQLite, and isn't as fancy as MySQL, which is typically used in the non-Lite version
* Development - everything (except that database) is packaged into one executable, so modifications aren't possible. For pursuing further development of SLIMarray, the full installation is necessary.

==Installation

===Windows

Prerequisite: Install SQLite from http://www.sqlite.org OR just download this file and extract the enclosed DLL into your SLIMarray folder: http://www.sqlite.org/sqlitedll-2_8_17.zip

3. Go into the slimarray_lite-0.1.0 directory where you extracted it, and double-click slimarray_lite.exe

SLIMarray Lite should now be running if you go to http://localhost:3000 in a web browser on the computer where you installed it.
