= Quickstart Notes for SLIMarray on Windows

== Download and install Ruby

- Go to http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org, click on [Download], and pick the 
latest stable   release (at the time of writing, this was ruby182-15.exe), to 
download it.
- Run the .exe file wherever it was downloaded, and choose to install all 
components.

== Download and install MySQL

- Go to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html. Under 'Windows 
downloads', choose 'Pick a mirror' for Windows (x86). At the time of writing, 
MySQL 5.0 was the most current release. Optionally fill out their questionaire, 
and then click on one of the mirrors in the lower part of the page to start 
downloading.
- Open the .zip file you've downloaded, and run the Setup.exe file that's 
inside. This will start the installation wizard. The default selections should 
be okay, so click [Next>] to go through the steps, and finally [Install].
- During the installation, you'll be presented with a sign-up wizard, where you 
can elect to create a MySQL.com account, or skip that step.
- Once installation is complete, make sure the 'Configure the MySQL Server now' 
box is checked, and click [Finish]
- In the MySQL Server Instance Configuration Wizard, choose 'Standard 
Configuration', then on the next page make sure that the 'Install As Windows 
Service' is checked, as well as 'Launch the MySQL Server automatically'. Check 
the box to 'Include Bin Directory in Windows PATH'.
- On the next page, make sure 'Modify Security Settings' is checked, and enter a 
root password. Remember this--you'll need it later. Leave 'Enable root access 
from remote machines' unchecked, as well as 'Create An Anonymous Account'
- On the next, final page, choose [Execute] to apply the settings you chose.

== Configure MySQL

1. Click Start -> All Programs -> MySQL -> MySQL Server 5.0 -> MySQL Command 
Line Client
2. Enter the password you chose in the previous secion.
3. You should now have a 'mysql>' command line. Enter the following command 
   to create the databases:

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE slimarray_production;
	mysql> CREATE DATABASE slimarray_development;
	mysql> CREATE DATABASE slimarray_test;
	mysql> quit

== Download SLIMarray and install

- Go to http://slimarray.systemsbiology.net/download and download 
slimarray-0.1.0.zip
- Extract the contents of the zip file into C:\Program Files

== Configuring SLIMarray

SLIMarray needs to be configured to connect with the MySQL databases you 
created. In the directory where you extracted SLIMarray (C:\Program 
Files\slimarray), make a copy of the file config/database.example file as 
config/database.yml. Edit slimarray/config/database.yml so that it 
contains the username and password that you've created for the production, 
development and test databases.

== Check out code and populate database

Open a command line window: Click Start -> Run, then enter 'cmd' in the dialog 
box that comes up. Enter the following:

	C:
	cd \Program Files\slimarray
	mysql -u root -p slimarray_development < db/default.mysql
	mysql -u root -p slimarray_production < db/default.mysql

== Start the web server

In the same windows as used in the previous step, enter:

	ruby script/server

== Conclusion

At this point, you should be able to open a web browser and have things work 
when you navigate to http://localhost:3000. The default username is 'admin' with 
a password (that should be changed to something less obvious) of 'admin'. Other 
installation options such as LDAP support, support for 'rake' tasks and Apache 
server support are described in the main SLIMarray_install.notes.
