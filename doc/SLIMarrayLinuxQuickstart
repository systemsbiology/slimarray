= Quickstart Notes for SLIMarray on Linux (generic)

This describes installation of SLIMarray on Linux without LDAP or development 
support, running on the WEBrick server. For other options, please refer to the 
more detailed SLIMarrayFullInstallNotes.

Configure your firewall to have port 3000 open

Install prerequisite sofware:

	wget
	mysql
	mysql-server
	ruby
	ruby-rdoc
	ruby-irb
	ruby-devel
	subversion

Install RubyGems:

	wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/5207/rubygems-0.8.11.tgz
	tar zxf rubygems-0.8.11.tgz
	cd rubygems-0.8.11
	sudo ruby setup.rb

MySQL Configuration:

Open up /etc/my.cnf and change the line that reads 'old_passwords=1' to 
'old_passwords=0'. Start mysqld with:

# usually this will do it (must be root)
sudo /sbin/service mysqld start

Configure mysql server databases and users:

	mysql -u root
	mysql> CREATE DATABASE slimarray_production;
	mysql> CREATE DATABASE slimarray_development;
	mysql> CREATE DATABASE slimarray_test;
	mysql> DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User = '';
	mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 
	'password_you_choose' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	mysql> quit

Configuring SLIMarray:

Copy chip_accounting/config/database.example to 
chip_accounting/config/database.yml. Edit chip_accounting/config/database.yml to 
make username: root and password: <password_you_chose_earlier> for all 3 
environments

Check out code and populate database:

	cd /path/where/you/want/slimarray
	svn co http://slimarray.systemsbiology.net/svn/trunk
	mysql -u root -p slimarray_development < db/default.mysql
	mysql -u root -p slimarray_production < db/default.mysql

Set permissions on scripts and run web server:

	chmod -R a+x script
	script/server

At this point, you should be able to open a web browser and have things work 
when you navigate to http://localhost:3000. The default username is 'admin' with 
a password (that should be changed to something less obvious) of 'admin'. Other 
installation options such as LDAP support, support for 'rake' tasks and Apache 
server support are described in the main SLIMarray_install.notes.
