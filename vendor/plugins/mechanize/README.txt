submitted.  Mechanize also keeps track of the sites that you have visited as
a history.

Note that the files in the net-overrides/ directory are taken from Ruby 1.9.0.

Ruby, my favorite language!

== Acknowledgments

This library was heavily influenced by its namesake in the perl world.  A big
thanks goes to Andy Lester (andy@petdance.com), the author of the original
perl Mechanize which is available here[http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/WWW-Mechanize-1.20/].  Ruby Mechanize would not be around without you!

Thank you to Michael Neumann for starting the Ruby version.  Thanks to everyone
who's helped out in various ways.  Finally, thank you to the people using this
library!
