= Naming Schemer

This plugin provides a set of models/views/controllers for providing naming schemes (controlled 
vocabulary) associated with a samples. It is an extraction from SLIMarray/SLIMseq, but not an 
incredibly clean one, so it does have a number of requirements on the application.

== Install

Install the plugin itself:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/bmarzolf/naming_schemer.git

Add the following associations to your Sample model (create one if you don't have one already):

  class Sample < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :naming_scheme
    
    has_many :sample_terms, :dependent => :destroy
    has_many :sample_texts, :dependent => :destroy

Add the routes to manage naming schemes in config/routes.rb

  map.resources :naming_schemes

Install FixtureReplacement in your application:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/smtlaissezfaire/fixturereplacement.git

Put the following in your db/example_data.rb:

  attributes_for :naming_element do |ne|
    ne.naming_scheme = default_naming_scheme
    ne.name = String.random
    ne.group_element = true
    ne.optional = true
    ne.free_text = false
    ne.dependent_element_id = nil
  end

  attributes_for :naming_scheme do |ns|
    ns.name = String.random
  end

  attributes_for :naming_term do |nt|
    nt.naming_element = default_naming_element
    nt.term = String.random
    nt.abbreviated_term = String.random(3)
  end

There are probably other dependencies between this plugin and the application; if you 
find any please pass them along.

== Usage

Link to the naming schemes management interface with this in your views:

  <%= link_to 'Naming Schemes', naming_schemes_path %>

To integrate with sample CRUD interfaces in your application, there aren't any pre-made templates
but you can refer to as an example:

  http://github.com/bmarzolf/slimseq
