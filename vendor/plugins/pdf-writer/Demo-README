= PDF::Writer Demo Programs
This package is a collection of demo programs for PDF::Writer for Ruby version
1.1.3, intended for users of the RubyGems package, because the demo programs
are not easily accessible. This package includes:

manual.pwd::      The text version of the PDF manual.
manual.pdf::      A pregenerated version of the PDF manual.
chunkybacon.rb::  A simple program to insert three images and two lines of
                  text
code.rb::         An example of a custom text formatting tag. Note that this
                  tag doesn't *quite* work as it should because of an as-yet
                  unidentified bug in PDF::Writer's tag handling code.
colornames.rb::   A program to generate colour names known to the color-tools
                  package.
demo.rb::         Generates gradients and coloured text.
gettysburg.rb::   Creates a PDF with the Gettysburg Address wrapped in a
                  rounded rectangle.
hello.rb::        A simple "Hello, Ruby" application for PDF::Writer.
individual-i.rb:: An example of drawing a vector graphic with PDF::Writer,
                  translated from the Individual I website's EPS version of
                  the logo.
pac.rb::          A vector graphics image based on a famous video game.
pagenumber.rb::   An example for showing PDF::Writer's page numbering.
qr-language.rb::  Generates a quick reference sheet for the Ruby language.
                  Based on Ryan Davis's quick reference sheet.
qr-library.rb::   Generates a quick reference sheet for the Ruby standard
                  library. Based on Ryan Davis's quick reference sheet.

If PDF::Writer has been installed with RubyGems, then the demos will need to
